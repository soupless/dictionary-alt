dictionary
==========

A package that allows you to create and use a dictionary saved as a JSON file.

What does the dictionary file look like?
----------------------------------------

A deserialized, typehinted contents of the JSON file is:

.. code-block :: python3

    {
        "title": str,
        "author": str,
        "description": str,
        "revision_date": str,
        "contents": {
            "<keyword>": {
                "definitions": list[str],
                "references": list[str]
            },
            ...
        }
    }

The ``<keyword>`` could be any string, and here, those are called keywords.

After processing the file, the ``Dictionary`` class only takes the ``contents`` and all other keys are properties.


Usage
-----

This package is compatible from Python 3.8 to Python 3.10.

To install, run
.. code-block :: console

    pip install https://github.com/soupless/dictionary.git

As of now, it is useful only if it was used through an interactive shell. To use the dictionary, import ``Dictionary`` from ``dictionary.main``.

Note that deleting a key and its value through the ``pop`` method or using the ``del`` keyword won't work to avoid data deletion. If one needs to delete the key, use the ``remove`` method. However, it is possible to delete the keys of a key of the dictionary, like ``del Dictionary(path)[keyword]['references']`` as the type of the value of the dictionary keys is ``dict`` and the deletion methods are not overridden. Please keep this in mind.

Please also take note that, while the ``clear`` method won't work, setting the value of the dictionary to ``{}`` will have the same effect.
